## **📍 Part 1: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

### **📝 Problem Statement**
The dataset contained multiple errors that affected the reliability of data analysis. The first step was to clean and structure the data to enable accurate modeling and forecasting.

### **📊 Methodology:**
✔ **Identified & Fixed Data Errors:** Corrected inconsistencies in numeric values, categorical variables, and missing entries.

✔ **Standardized Formats & Removed Outliers:** Ensured uniformity in data types and removed extreme values that skewed analysis.

✔ **Dropped Irrelevant Columns:** Eliminated unnecessary attributes that did not contribute to the prediction model.

✔ **Handled Categorical Variables:** Reformatted qualitative data for machine learning compatibility.

### **✅ Key Findings:**
- **Incorrect values in sales percentages and staff-related data were corrected.**
- **Non-numeric characters in revenue-related fields were removed to enable statistical modeling.**
- **Duplicated store records were eliminated.**
- **Standardized customer feedback scores and sales figures for accurate segmentation.**

## **📍 Part 2: Revenue Analysis & Predictive Modeling**

### **📝 Problem Statement**
After cleaning the data, we applied **regression modeling and market segmentation techniques** to determine key revenue drivers.

### **📊 Methodology:**
✔ **Regression Analysis (Multiple Linear Regression):** Used to identify factors influencing total sales.  
✔ **Market Segmentation:** Categorized stores based on location, customer demographics, and product types.  
✔ **Predictive Analytics:** Forecasted future sales performance using historical data patterns.  
✔ **Data Visualization (Tableau & Excel Charts):** Created dashboards to track revenue trends and store performance.  

### **✅ Key Findings:**
- **Store location significantly affects sales performance.** Stand-alone stores in the **SouthEast region generated the highest revenue.**
- **Customer service experience correlates strongly with total sales.**
- **Retail stores with AI-based recommendation systems saw increased revenue in select regions.**
- **Online promotions and in-store loyalty programs led to higher customer retention rates.**

## **📍 Part 3: Store Performance & Business Recommendations**

### **📝 Problem Statement**
The final phase involved **evaluating store profitability, operational efficiency, and customer purchasing behavior** to provide actionable business recommendations.

### **📊 Methodology:**
✔ **Store Location vs. Revenue:** Analyzed sales trends across malls vs. stand-alone locations.  
✔ **Customer Behavior Analysis:** Measured the impact of loyalty programs, social media traffic, and promotional campaigns.  
✔ **Profitability Forecasting:** Modeled expected sales based on optimized data inputs.  
✔ **Sales Background & Performance Correlation:** Compared store staff experience with revenue generation.

### **✅ Key Findings & Recommendations:**
- **Invest in stand-alone stores in high-traffic areas** rather than mall locations for increased profitability.
- **Focus on customer service improvements**, as it has the highest correlation with revenue growth.
- **Use AI-driven product recommendations** selectively, as it benefits some regions but not others.
- **Expand marketing strategies via Facebook promotions**, as data shows a direct correlation between social media engagement and sales.
